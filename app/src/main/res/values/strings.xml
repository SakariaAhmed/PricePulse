        The purpose of this app is to show the electricity
        price for a timeframe, and show the cost for common appliances during the
        different timeframes. \n\n The home screen shows the current spot price for the
        user, while the electricity screen shows the electricity price for the
        current day and the chosen region. \n\n The appliances screen shows the price
        of using the appliance that was chosen as a graph or a table. The settings screen provides
        you the oppurtunity to change the region, and gives you important information about this application.
